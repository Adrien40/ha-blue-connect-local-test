A **100% local integration for Home Assistant** that turns your Blue Connect analyzer into a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor, letting you control and monitor your pool with zero dependency on the Cloud. 🛡️

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This integration queries the Blue Connect directly over Bluetooth.

### 💡 Why This Integration?
This integration frees your Blue Connect from the Cloud by directly leveraging its BLE protocol, for uncompromising home automation:

* **🔒 100% local:** Works without internet. Your data goes straight from the pool to Home Assistant.
* **⏱️ No API limits:** Passive listening to regular data frames, plus the ability to force a measurement on demand, with no restrictions.
* **🛡️ Longevity:** Total independence from official servers, so your hardware keeps working for the long haul.

**Blue Connect Local** is the result of in-depth **reverse engineering** work to turn your analyzer into a true local, industrial-grade sensor capable of communicating directly with your Home Assistant instance.
Blue Connect Local replaces the cloud with a **local control** solution, while offering a reliable **pool monitoring** system built on a **BLE sensor**.

### ✅ Compatibility / Requirements
* 🏷️ **Supported models**: ZODIAC Blue Connect (Gold / Silver) with **automatic detection and adaptation** of sensors (Conductivity and Salinity).
* 🏅 **Tested on**: Validated on the **ZODIAC Blue Connect Gold and Silver**.
* 🔑 **Access Code (Optional)**: Your device's 9-character access code. It isn't required for passive listening, but it is **essential** for on-demand analyses.
* 🛠️ **Required hardware**: Internal Bluetooth adapter, USB Bluetooth dongle, or an **ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy** (strongly recommended, [easy installation here](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/)).
* 📶 **Signal quality**: A stable RSSI signal (ideally **above -75 dBm**) is essential to guarantee a reliable connection to the Blue Connect. Testing shows that a signal below -90 dBm causes frequent read failures.
* ⏱️ **Real-time monitoring**: A `sensor.*_signal_bluetooth` entity uses Home Assistant's passive listening so you can watch signal strength live — all without draining the Blue Connect's battery!

> ❌ **Not compatible**: Blueriiot versions are not supported.

### 🧪 Chemical Expertise: Professional-Grade Analysis

👉 No need to understand these calculations — Home Assistant automates everything.

<details>
<summary>🔬 See the scientific details</summary>

#### Water Balance: Langelier Saturation Index & Taylor Balance ⚖️
The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is the essential companion to the **Taylor Balance**. It tells you whether your water is:
* **Corrosive (LSI < -0.3)**: The water attacks your seals, liner, and metal parts.
* **Balanced (LSI between -0.3 and +0.3)**: Perfect water.
* **Scale-forming (LSI > +0.3)**: Risk of limescale buildup.

Enter your TAC (Total Alkalinity), TH (Total Hardness), and TDS in the options, and Home Assistant will calculate your balance live, based on the temperature read from the Blue Connect!

### 🎯 A Note on Measurement Accuracy
Values shown in Home Assistant may differ slightly from those in the official Blue Connect app.

Blue Connect Local supports "high-precision" calibration. Unlike the mobile app, which uses fixed values, our integration lets you enter the exact value of your buffer solution (pH 7.02, 4.01, etc.), adjusted for temperature during calibration. This scientific rigor is what can create a slight offset — a sign that the reading is actually closer to your pool's true conditions. 🔬

---

## 🚀 Configuration
> ⚠️ Requires **Home Assistant 2026.3.0 or newer** (the first release shipped with Python 3.14). Tested on 2026.3.0 and 2026.9.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. The integration should automatically detect your Blue Connect if your Bluetooth dongle/antenna is in range. Otherwise, click **Add Integration** and search for **Blue Connect Local**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set your treatment type (Chlorine, Bromine) and your probe calibration/offset.

### ⚙️ Options, Calibration & Alerts
Once the device has been added, you can click **Configure** ⚙️ to:
* Adjust the values of your calibration solutions (pH 4, pH 7, Redox).
* Update your water parameters (TAC, TH, TDS, Stabilizer) directly via the exposed controls.
* Set your own **custom alert thresholds** (pH Min/Max, ORP Min/Max, etc.) to drive your own automations.

---

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>⚠️ See common issues</summary>
  
* **Frequent Bluetooth errors**: The integration automatically handles connection retries. If the sensor shows `Signal Lost`, the Blue Connect is out of range. Move your antenna closer, or [install an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/) as close to the pool as possible (all you need is an ESP32 (~€10) and a USB charger).
* **Invalid access code**: The integration checks your access code as soon as it connects, so if it's wrong you'll see `Invalid access code` on the Bluetooth State sensor within seconds — no need to wait for the full analysis timeout. Just correct it in **Configure ⚙️**, an analysis is triggered automatically once you save.

## 🧂 Why there is no chlorine sensor

The ORP (Redox) probe measures the oxidising strength of the water, not a chlorine concentration: for the same amount of chlorine the reading changes with pH, temperature, stabilizer (CYA), other oxidisers and probe ageing. Converting one mV value into "x ppm" hides all of these unknowns, and a wrong but precise-looking chlorine value is worse than none. This integration therefore exposes the **ORP (Redox)** value (calibrated) and the **Raw ORP** diagnostic sensor to calibrate the probe on a reference solution, and leaves the actual chlorine level to a test kit.
